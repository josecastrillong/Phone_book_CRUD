# Phone_book_CRUD :ledger: :pen: :iphone:

### Description
This repository was made to practice the most common methods of HTTP (GET, DELETE POST), using a phone book CRUD as study case. Also, some error handling was implemented using try-catch statements. 

The project core was build with express.js for the restAPI calls. To restart the server an make the workflow smoother I used nodemon.js which restarts the node application when a file changes in the directory. Last, a HTTP request logger middleware for node.js named morgan was implemented so the information of the request can be seen in the console.
